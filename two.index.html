                        <p class="article-a">Around 50 years ago, the editors of a magazine called Travel  made a big leap forward, embracing not just photography, but the entire world. They'd cover food, wine, fashion, hotels, cruises, beaches, cities, hiking, skiing — just about anything that anybody would do for fun. They'd need a new name — Travel — and a new look for that magazine.
                            Much has changed since our first issue was published back in 1971 — for starters, we swapped the ampersand sign for a plus symbol and we launched this website in 1998. But one thing remained the same — and that's our passion for travel, both near and far. Today, we reach more than 16 million travelers every month, and our team includes a network of hundreds of writers and photographers across the globe, all providing a local eye on the best places to stay, eat, see, and explore.

As a top travel media brand in the world, Travel  mission is to inform and inspire passionate travelers, like you. We celebrate travel and provide service and inspiration at every point of your journey, from trip ideas to nitty-gritty logistics. We cover small towns and big cities, hidden gems and tried-and-true destinations, beaches and lakes, mountains and valleys, national parks and outdoor adventures, road trips and cruises, fine-dining experiences and secret hole-in-the-wall establishments, and everything in between.

And because, above all, our goal is to help our readers make the most of their invaluable free time, we're not afraid to lean into the second half of our name — leisure — and cover all the ways to enjoy life at home, too. Our travel experiences influence much of what we practice in between trips, and whether we're transforming our bedrooms using luxury hotel tricks or applying beauty regimens we admired abroad, we love to share our learnings.
